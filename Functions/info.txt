TWIN PRIMES IN A RANGE OF NUMBERS
-----------------------------------

Twin primes are two consequetive odd numbers that are prime.

Write a function that returns 1 if the input is a prime and
0 otherwise.

int is_prime(int number) {
}

Write a C Program to generate all twin primes in a given range
of numbers using the is_prime function.

Your program will input following from the command line:

min : start of range, an integer

max : end of range, an integer

These numbers define the range of numbers [min,max]
inclusively.


Here is a sample input line:

1 7

We will output every twin prime in the range
[1, 7].

Here is the output of the above input line:

3 5
5 7
